# **FP2 \- Evaluation of the Final project**

## Project Description

I intend to use JavaScript to add interactivity into the homepage of my existing portfolio. In addition to this goal, I also intend on cleaning up the organization and implementation of the original code to be aligned with best practices. 

## High-Fi Prototypes

### *Prototype 1*

![Mountain Landscape Parallax](./imgs/parallax-1.png)

Users liked how the concept aligned with my professional brand, and thought the illustration would be a unique way to show off multiple of my skills.

### *Prototype 2*

![Abstract Animation](./imgs/abstract-1.png)

Users thought the animation was very eye catching.   

## Usability Test

During usability testing of my prototypes, users provided valuable feedback on areas for improvement During usability testing of my prototypes, users provided valuable feedback on areas for improvement and challenged me to choose ideas that were more feasible and better aligned with my story. One of the prototypes I presented featured a parallax effect of a mountain landscape. Users suggested that adding more visual assets would enhance the experience, making the image more engaging. Specifically, they recommended incorporating elements like wind turbines to emphasize the theme of nature and renewable energy, along with movable clouds to create a more dynamic scrolling interaction.

I also addressed earlier feedback about my portfolio homepage. Previously, I had a generic statement about my skills as a UX Designer, which users felt was unnecessary. However, they appreciated the inclusion of my work and academic experiences. For my updated prototype, I simplified the homepage to feature only my job title, name, and highlights of my most recent work and academic experiences. This approach was intended to encourage users to scroll and interact with the parallax effect, making the experience more exploratory and engaging.

For the more abstract version of my website, users appreciated that it was more engaging compared to the previous prototype, particularly because the interactivity was accessible without any need for scrolling. However, they suggested that the animation would be more captivating if it incorporated additional lines. I updated the designs accordingly to reflect this feedback. While users found the animation visually striking and attention-grabbing, they also felt that the earlier prototype better conveyed my identity as a designer, as it directly connected to my transition into the energy industry.
 

## Updated Designs

For the Mountain Landscape Parallax, I added in the wind turbines to better reflect the theme and clouds to make the parallax look more realistic.

I made the lines thinner and added an animation of the arrow bouncing to draw the user's attention to the next portion of the website. 

## Feedback Summary

When usability testing my homepage design, I also shared my current website to gather additional feedback on other project components. Users pointed out that the headings on my individual project pages should emphasize the key takeaways from each exercise, rather than simply naming the exercise itself. For instance, instead of labeling a section on “Bubbly” as “Competitor Analysis,” they suggested using a more meaningful heading like “Existing apps charge for necessary customization,” which better captures the main insight.

Users also encouraged me to think about how my professional brand should be represented in my portfolio. I presented two concepts, but I felt much more confident about the mountain landscape idea because it ties closely to my transition into the energy industry. Beyond being more relevant to my story, users agreed that this idea was visually richer and more engaging, especially after I incorporated additional assets into the design.

I updated my designs by adding new assets to make the parallax effect more realistic and engaging. Instead of featuring only a mountain landscape, I incorporated wind turbines and clouds to enhance the scene's depth and interest. The clouds were designed to move, contributing to the parallax effect, and I’m considering animating the turbines to spin, adding a more dynamic and immediate sense of animation to this version. 


## Milestones

With FP1 and FP2 completed and the parallax option selected, my plan now focuses on three main components. First, I need to review my existing code and create a strategy for replacing any elements that are not accessible. On my project pages, several components should be coded rather than displayed as images, so I need to determine the best way to present that information effectively.

Once I have a solution for these accessibility challenges, I’ll move on to developing the parallax component of the project. This will involve creating custom assets in Illustrator and using JavaScript to integrate them into my homepage. Fine-tuning the parallax effect will require some time, so I’m estimating about a week and a half for that part of the process. After completing the parallax homepage—which is my primary goal—I plan to use the remaining time to optimize my code and align it with best practices.

### *Libraries and Other Components*

I plan to implement the parallax effect using vanilla JavaScript, though further research may reveal that it could be more efficient to incorporate it with frameworks like React or jQuery. Additionally, I’ll be using Bootstrap as the foundational framework for this project.


## Generative AI Use Plan

I plan to leverage generative AI to learn more about implementing parallax effects, assist with debugging my code, and potentially generate imagery for the scenery on my website. I'm especially interested in using AI for image generation to inspire and enhance my design ideas.


### *Tool Use*

* ChatGPT  
  * I will use it to learn about parallax because it can help me understand how it works and what information might be helpful in approaching this from both a design and development perspective 
  * I will not use it for creating assets because it might not be able to help me with creating high quality illustrations that I am able to use on my website.  
* Illustrator
  * I will use it to draw my assets because it is an efficient tool that I am familiar with
  * The generative features in Illustrator might not be able to help me with idea generation, but for simple things like blurring backgrounds and blending colors.

### *Responsible Use*

I will use AI responsibly by crediting it when I have used it to generate design assets. I will also provide credit if a method of writing code I have used was taught to me by the AI as well. 


# **FP1 \- Proposal for Critique**

## Idea Sketches

### *Idea 1*

![Portfolio Revamp](./imgs/portfolio.png)

* The goal of this portfolio redesign is to transform my existing portfolio into a more unique and polished representation of my skills while adhering to coding best practices. 
* I intend to add interactivity through JavaScript on the website homepage and About Me page. I will have an interactive resume on the About Me page and an animated background on the homepage.   
* I will make my design accessible by removing many of the images that I have used to convey stages of my projects on the Project pages. Additionally, I will follow accessibility best practices by ensuring there is an appropriate text hierarchy, high color contrast, descriptive alt text, etc. 
* I want to convey that I’m not only a skilled UX Designer but also proficient in front-end development. The design of the portfolio itself should also showcase my strengths as a UX Designer, not just the projects I’ve included.

### *Idea 2*

![Weather Dashboard](./imgs/weather.png)

* The idea is to have a weather dashboard that will show a variety of weather-related information about a given city that a user has typed in. 
* Users will be able to search for and change the city they are viewing information for. 
* My weather dashboard will follow accessibility best practices by ensuring there is an appropriate text hierarchy and high color contrast. 
* The goal of this weather dashboard is to increase my practical experience working with JavaScript, and to show that I am capable of both designing and developing front-end applications. 

### *Idea 3*

![Color Contrast Checker](./imgs/color-contrast.png)

* This website will enable users to input two hex codes to check if the colors have an appropriate amount of contrast from each other. 
* There will be a visual next to the hex code checker that shows how the design changes based on user input. 
* Aside from following accessibility best practices, this website itself is an accessibility tool in helping users determine if their colors have an appropriate amount of contrast to pass various WCAG standards. 
* The goal of this color contrast checker is to increase my practical experience working with JavaScript and to gain familiarity with color contrast ratios. 

## Feedback Summary

For my revamped portfolio, my classmates cautioned me against including too much JavaScript interactivity to the point where it detracts from the main objective of my portfolio, which is to highlight my case study projects. However, they were enthusiastic about using interactivity to strategically engage users on the homepage and resume page. They saw this idea as a strong opportunity to enhance my portfolio, especially since it’s already coded, and suggested it would be a great wrap-up to the course to showcase everything I’ve learned about best practices, code organization, and accessibility. As a UX Designer, they also thought this would be the most beneficial to my career development. They were less excited about my weather dashboard project, but understood my reasoning. I wanted to gain foundational experience working with APIs, focusing less on the design and more on the dashboard’s functionality. My classmates felt I could showcase my creativity in better ways. They did however acknowledge that a JavaScript-heavy project would increase my empathy as a designer when collaborating with developers. One classmate also pointed out that, given the time constraints, this project might be the most feasible. The color contrast checker was a popular idea, especially if I incorporated gamification. Instead of simply letting users input hex codes, what if they were given two colors and asked to guess the contrast ratio? They did warn me about the challenges of finding a color contrast API and suggested I might need to calculate the ratios manually. They also encouraged me to think about how this design would translate to mobile devices and whether it would be as impactful of an experience. If the point is for the user to see how changing the hex codes affects the contrast of the letter on top of the box, a mobile experience may not be very effective in demonstrating the concept. 


## Feedback Digestion

I believe the feedback on my revamped portfolio was thoughtful and helpful. One suggestion I plan to explore further is how I want the landing page to function. Should I prioritize introducing myself with a full-screen introduction that encourages hiring managers to scroll down to see my projects, or should I opt for a brief introduction with more emphasis on showcasing my case studies right from the start? I'll need to reflect on this distinction and brainstorm how each approach could shape the overall look and feel of my portfolio with additional sketches. While the weather dashboard offers valuable experience with APIs, I do agree that it doesn’t fully reflect my creative abilities as a designer. My goal is to showcase myself as a UX designer with front-end development skills, and having a project that replicates a simple concept might detract from the other more creative pieces in my portfolio. Although working on this project would likely improve my empathy for developers, I believe the same could be said for the other ideas as well. I do have some concerns about time constraints with the other projects in terms of how much I can realistically accomplish, but I am not sure this would be as worthwhile in the end. As for the color contrast checker, the gamification idea is interesting, but it diverges from my original intent of creating a practical tool for designers to adjust hex codes. Gamifying the experience would make it more educational about contrast ratios rather than a functional design tool. If I pursue this project, I’ll need to reconsider my approach and adjust my expectations to better incorporate the gamification element since it was so popular.
