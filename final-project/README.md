# **FP1 \- Proposal for Critique**

## Idea Sketches

### *Idea 1*

![Portfolio Revamp](./imgs/portfolio.png)

* The goal of this portfolio redesign is to transform my existing portfolio into a more unique and polished representation of my skills while adhering to coding best practices. 
* I intend to add interactivity through JavaScript on the website homepage and About Me page. I will have an interactive resume on the About Me page and an animated background on the homepage.   
* I will make my design accessible by removing many of the images that I have used to convey stages of my projects on the Project pages. Additionally, I will follow accessibility best practices by ensuring there is an appropriate text hierarchy, high color contrast, descriptive alt text, etc. 
* I want to convey that I’m not only a skilled UX Designer but also proficient in front-end development. The design of the portfolio itself should also showcase my strengths as a UX Designer, not just the projects I’ve included.

### *Idea 2*

![Weather Dashboard](./imgs/weather.png)

* The idea is to have a weather dashboard that will show a variety of weather-related information about a given city that a user has typed in. 
* Users will be able to search for and change the city they are viewing information for. 
* My weather dashboard will follow accessibility best practices by ensuring there is an appropriate text hierarchy and high color contrast. 
* The goal of this weather dashboard is to increase my practical experience working with JavaScript, and to show that I am capable of both designing and developing front-end applications. 

### *Idea 3*

![Color Contrast Checker](./imgs/color-contrast.png)

* This website will enable users to input two hex codes to check if the colors have an appropriate amount of contrast from each other. 
* There will be a visual next to the hex code checker that shows how the design changes based on user input. 
* Aside from following accessibility best practices, this website itself is an accessibility tool in helping users determine if their colors have an appropriate amount of contrast to pass various WCAG standards. 
* The goal of this color contrast checker is to increase my practical experience working with JavaScript and to gain familiarity with color contrast ratios. 

## Feedback Summary

For my revamped portfolio, my classmates cautioned me against including too much JavaScript interactivity to the point where it detracts from the main objective of my portfolio, which is to highlight my case study projects. However, they were enthusiastic about using interactivity to strategically engage users on the homepage and resume page. They saw this idea as a strong opportunity to enhance my portfolio, especially since it’s already coded, and suggested it would be a great wrap-up to the course to showcase everything I’ve learned about best practices, code organization, and accessibility. As a UX Designer, they also thought this would be the most beneficial to my career development. They were less excited about my weather dashboard project, but understood my reasoning. I wanted to gain foundational experience working with APIs, focusing less on the design and more on the dashboard’s functionality. My classmates felt I could showcase my creativity in better ways. They did however acknowledge that a JavaScript-heavy project would increase my empathy as a designer when collaborating with developers. One classmate also pointed out that, given the time constraints, this project might be the most feasible. The color contrast checker was a popular idea, especially if I incorporated gamification. Instead of simply letting users input hex codes, what if they were given two colors and asked to guess the contrast ratio? They did warn me about the challenges of finding a color contrast API and suggested I might need to calculate the ratios manually. They also encouraged me to think about how this design would translate to mobile devices and whether it would be as impactful of an experience. If the point is for the user to see how changing the hex codes affects the contrast of the letter on top of the box, a mobile experience may not be very effective in demonstrating the concept. 


## Feedback Digestion

I believe the feedback on my revamped portfolio was thoughtful and helpful. One suggestion I plan to explore further is how I want the landing page to function. Should I prioritize introducing myself with a full-screen introduction that encourages hiring managers to scroll down to see my projects, or should I opt for a brief introduction with more emphasis on showcasing my case studies right from the start? I'll need to reflect on this distinction and brainstorm how each approach could shape the overall look and feel of my portfolio with additional sketches. While the weather dashboard offers valuable experience with APIs, I do agree that it doesn’t fully reflect my creative abilities as a designer. My goal is to showcase myself as a UX designer with front-end development skills, and having a project that replicates a simple concept might detract from the other more creative pieces in my portfolio. Although working on this project would likely improve my empathy for developers, I believe the same could be said for the other ideas as well. I do have some concerns about time constraints with the other projects in terms of how much I can realistically accomplish, but I am not sure this would be as worthwhile in the end. As for the color contrast checker, the gamification idea is interesting, but it diverges from my original intent of creating a practical tool for designers to adjust hex codes. Gamifying the experience would make it more educational about contrast ratios rather than a functional design tool. If I pursue this project, I’ll need to reconsider my approach and adjust my expectations to better incorporate the gamification element since it was so popular.
